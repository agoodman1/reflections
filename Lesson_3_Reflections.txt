When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when you are collaborating with others or if you want to access your work from somewhere other than your own computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Automatic updates may result in incomplete or not working code being pulled into the repository.
